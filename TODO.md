## TODO
* Unit test the private VimeoPlaylist VimeoVideos fetcher class
* Unit test the YouTube videos method (probably belong in a seperate class anyway)
* Would be cool if fetcher memomized requests it's made to URL's with their corresponding unpacked object. Then I could stop memorizing on a provider instance level.
* Add some more videos hosts
* Inject dependancies into classes so I can stub and mocking unit tests less
